                        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Education</h2>
                        <p>I have achieved several educational milestones throughout my academic journey. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Brigham Young University (BYU) in April 2022. Following that, I pursued a Master's degree in Public Administration, which I am on track to complete in April 2024.</p>
                        <p>In addition to my degrees, I have also taken on leadership responsibilities as the founding president of the BYU Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) Student Chapter. This role allowed me to showcase my leadership skills and actively contribute to extracurricular activities related to my field of study.</p>
                        <p>My educational accomplishments highlight my commitment to advancing my knowledge and expertise in my field of interest. It all began with my Bachelor's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from BYU, and I am now on my way to completing a Master's degree in Public Administration, which will further enhance my qualifications.</p>
